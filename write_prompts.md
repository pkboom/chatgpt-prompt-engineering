# Prompt writing

### Assign a role to AI

"You will take the role of a [role],"

#### Roles

- a social media expert
- compassionate speaker
- personal development coach

### Give A Clear, Descriptive, And Accurate Task

### Provide Context & Examples

Examples will help the AI emulate a style and do exactly what you want.

### Create Rules

Ask for the output in a two column table, in sentence case, or explained in a way a 5-year-old could understand. Ask for a specific number of words per sentence, ask for certain objects to be mentioned, instruct it along the straight and narrow like the strictest of headmasters.

### Create Constraints

Tell AI what to avoid.

e.g. "Don’t use two words when one will suffice." "Don’t use idioms." "Don’t alienate the audience by [action]." "Don’t use the letter W."

### Evaluate And Iterate

The process is iterative, so after each set of results, evaluate, make changes to your prompt and see if you can get better results.

Save your prompt. Keep refining it over time so, one day soon, you will find the perfect recipe that can keep delivering. It might take a few weeks. Make the prompt a little better each time. Think small, iterative changes, not wholesale edits or going back to the drawing board.
